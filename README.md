# Audio-and-Image-Encryption-using-Hybrid-Cryptography
Hybrid Encryption is a concept in cryptography which combines/merge two or more cryptography algorithms to generate more effective encrypted text. 
 The hybrid cryptography provides a combined strength of two different encryption technique that provides a highly secure way of maintaining data security. Due to the critical nature of valuable data, the demand for secure data storage platforms has increased drastically in recent years. This growth in multimedia applications includes
audio, video and image types of data which are widely adopted in operating systems such as wireless multimedia sensor networks, medical field, security, spying, civil and military applications. The multimedia data is stored in an open environment which is considered prone to the security threats hence, security is the prime concern in various fields. With the increasing amount of data security breaches like password attacks, data corruption and unauthorized access, many government agencies, companies and even remotely running companies are taking major step towards the threats of data security. This motivated us to get to know the nuances behind data security and look for the measures to protect our private data.
